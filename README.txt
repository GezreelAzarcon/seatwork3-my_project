I am interested on making a simple automatic program that will help me choose a series from my personal watchlist.

Demonstration Video: https://youtu.be/7QZ6eW6A820

Idea: In this program I will get to choose what to watch depending on the genre, how long the series is, and whether the anime is a series or a movie. The program will sort the different anime shows based on the given conditions and choose one at random.
